♪ Nagaraja, the supreme serpent will lead us into a new world ♫

♪ For Raudr will return and see all the errors done in his stead ♫

♪ he will wail, a wail so loud and long that the world will tremble ♫

♪ with the great tremble, the ground and sky will move ♫

♪ move, until the Stream of the Silent unites with Deadwood River ♫

♪ in this union, all will turn a bright green ♫

♪ from this green, Acropolis shall fall from the sky ♫

♪ upon this fall, acronians will see Raudr and fight a great battle ♫

♪ those who battle, will be a feast for the supreme serpent ♫

♪ with this feast, Nagaraja will grow, and grow until it swallows the Moons! ♫

♪ inside Nagaraja, a world will form anew. ♫

♪ Oh great Nagaraja! We await The Great Feast! ♫
